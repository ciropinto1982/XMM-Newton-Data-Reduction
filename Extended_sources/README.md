- RGS_data_reduction_extended_src.sh is a tutorial to learn the basic reduction for RGS data (especially to align spectra)

- trafo_sector2_RGS.sh is a simple script which manages RGS order 1 and 2 spectra into 2 sectors for ad-hoc simultaneous fits

- MOS_data_reduction_RGSmodule.sh is a quick auxiliary module that uses MOS1 data to estimate RGS line instrumental broadening. It also outputs the plot in the PDF file RGS_lineprof_cum.pdf and the SPEX-LPRO-input in the ASCII file mos1_band_RGS_det.0p4.10am.txt (Average profile)

- A3526_RGSfits.com is a simple SPEX executable / tutorial that explains how to fit the RGS spectra orders 1,2 of an extended source. It also outputs the plot in the PDF file: A3526_RGS.pdf
