# XMM-Newton-Data-Reduction
Basic codes to run data reduction of the XMM-Newton satellite

- /Reduction-In-Loop/ directory shows an example of how to run a full XMM data reduction over a given number of sources and exposures.

- XMM_data_reduction_single.sh is a comprehensive tutorial to learn from scratch the basic data reduction for EPIC and RGS data (spectra and lightcurves).
