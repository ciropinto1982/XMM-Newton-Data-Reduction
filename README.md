# XMM-Newton-Data-Reduction
Basic codes to run data reduction of the XMM-Newton satellite

- /Reduction-In-Loop/ directory shows an example of how to run a full XMM data reduction over a given number of sources and exposures.

- XMM_data_reduction_single.sh is a comprehensive tutorial to learn from scratch the basic data reduction for EPIC and RGS data (spectra and lightcurves).

You may refer to this when using this code, especially to compare the spectra and lightcurves that you make using it. 

- /Extended_sources/ is a tutorial to learn the basic reduction for RGS/EPIC data for extended sources especially to align spectra and correct line broadening
