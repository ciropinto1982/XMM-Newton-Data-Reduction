Complete code that runs EPIC and RGS data reduction of the XMM-Newton satellite in loop

The routine UNIX_data_reduction_XMM_mac.sh runs the XMM-SAS in loop throughout two lists of sources (list_of_src.txt) and exposures (list_of_exp.txt). The coordinates for the source (SRC1_coordinates.txt) and the background (BKG1_coordinates.txt) regions are examples of those used by the routines.
